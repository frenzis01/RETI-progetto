## **WINSOME** - a re**W**ard**IN**g **SO**cial **ME**dia 

A _**Steemit**-inspired_ social media implemented in Java using **NIO** and ~"overkill"~ synchronization mechanisms to handle ~unnecessary~ multiple threads working simultaneously on the same resources. **Jackson** is used to backup and restore the server's status. **RMI** is used to implement some of the server API functions.

This implementation reflects a typical _client-server_ architecture that allows multiple clients to connect to a monolithic server
